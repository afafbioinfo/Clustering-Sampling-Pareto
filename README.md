# Clustering-Sampling-Pareto
@author SAAIDI AFAF 2016 AMIB Team, LIX.

The main file is RNAstruct.py
Parameters could be adjusted through the file RNAstruct.config

A stochastical sampling using RNAsubopt is ensured to generate Secondary structures.
An algorithm to agglomerate close structures in term of base pairs distances is used [Package scikit-learn].
A pareto front is visualized to choose the optimal clusters represented by their centroids as the MEA structure.
